\section{Perspectives}
By the end of this study, we have gathered enough guidelines to make the tests more reproducible, accurate.
We created a set of new tests named \textbf{energy tests} which are more similar to performance tests.
Thanks to the work of two interns [ mamadou and adrien] we created a CI/CD platform to measure the energy consumption of Java projects and we could track the evolution of the this energy across different stages of the project.
In the figure below we see an example of this plugin.

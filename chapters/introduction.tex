\label{chapter:introduction}

Basically we want to save the planet, and save your pockets within it.
We know that humans don't care about anything else except their pockets. So let's try to push them into saving our mother earth by making them reduce their costs and increase their benifits.
How to do so ?
well we will work on reducing the elecricity consumption of their services. without making them to change their machines, their providers or impacting the quality of service that they provide.

Our approach is is to reduce the energy consumption of the software services by changing certains parameters, such as palteform, programming langauge, and/or the design pattern.

well to do so we have multiple approachs ,
1- by using formal apporachs such as static analysers, complexity , nad programming theories -- lets check maybe there is a state of the art -
2- second by a more interactive appreach where based on tests and feedback

This theis is about the second one, So basically all we do is testing programms, measuring their energy and then provide a feedback based on our observations.
To do so we first need to setup a testing enviroment. something that allows us to have accurate, precise and reproductible tests.
Therefore the first chapter our the thesis will be dedicated to provide green coders with a set of elements in orders to test their hypothesis.

Nowdays, computers are invasing our daily life from work to leasure, from fancy smartphone to an embded peacemaker that regulatres the heartbeat of some people. As human beigns we are known to use tools to enhance our bodies. And thanks to computers we pushed that step even further where now we are using machines to extend our brains. Some even argue that one day they will replace us, and therefore we created our own ending. Well this is the problem for the future generations. For the moment, the main concern of humanity is to keep this planet livebale until we find another alternative.

Unfortunately those machines doesn't help that much. as according to .... ....

Researchers are trying to solve this issue through different angles.
While some scientists are trying to find an alternative green source to generate energy. others focus on reducing it's consumption. In computer science we are concerned with the ladder solution.  Therefore most of the works are done on tunning the software and the hardware in ordrer to have a more efficient way use this energy.

In this thesis we are trying to find a way to make the energy consumption of the computer to be as low as possible.
Our approach is is to reduce the energy consumption of the software services by changing certains parameters, such as palteform, programming langauge, and/or the design pattern.

The best way to do so is to formulate a theory behind the energy consumption of algorthms such as the complexity and the o notation.
Unfortunately this is not possible in the current state of the art. due to the lack of knowledge about the energy consumption of the algorithms, and the strong correlation between this consumption and the hardware configuration.

Unlike algrothim optimization in the field of perfornacne which is agnostic toward the plateform. the energy consumption of the algorithms is dependent on execution environement.
Therefore, for the moment we will start by formulating some hypthosis and explore them using empirical analysis.

Our work will be presented through the following chapters :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \ref{chapter:literature_review}: Where we discuss the work done on the energy consumption and optimization in software engineering
    \item \ref{chapter:benchmarking}: It will present a set of guidelines and tools to help practitioners measure the energy consumption of their algorithms.
    \item : we will present the impact of programming languages on the energy consumption of the algorithms.
    \item : it will discuss the behaviour of python and the possibile ways to tune it in ordrer to reduce the energy consumpion
    \item : will present a study on java programming language and the impact of the JVM choice on the energy consumpion
    \item : as a prespective we introduce the impact of parallelisme on the enrgy consumption on time agnostic cases

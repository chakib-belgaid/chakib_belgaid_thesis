These measurements are easily accessible by the user, and can be gathered by a wide variety of tools, including the Linux perf_event interface. This allows unprecedented easy access to energy information when designing and optimizing energy-aware code.While greatly useful, on most systems these RAPL measurements are estimated values, generated on the fly by an on-chip energy model. The values are not documented well, and the results (especially the DRAM results) have undergone only limited validation.We validate the DRAM RAPL results on both desktop and server Haswell machines, with multiple types of DDR3 and DDR4 memory. We instrument the hardware to gather actual power measurements and compare them to the RAPL values returned via Linux perf_event. We describe the many challenges encountered when instrumenting systems for detailed power measurement.We find that the RAPL results match overall energy and power trends, usually by a constant power offset. The results match best when the DRAM is being heavily utilized, but do not match as well in cases where the system is idle, or when an integrated GPU is using the memory.We also verify that Haswell server machines produce more accurate results, as they include actual power measurements gathered through the integrated voltage regulator.},

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple--seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language. 0201485672B04062001}

	abstract     = {Cloud Patterns are abstract solutions to recurrent design problems in the cloud. Previous work has shown that these patterns can improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of cloud applications but their impact on energy consumption is still unknown. Yet, energy consumption is the biggest challenge that cloud computing systems (the backbone of today's high-tech economy) face today. In fact, 10\% of the world's electricity is now being consumed by servers, laptops, tablets and smartphones. Energy consumption has complex dependencies on the hardware platform, and the multiple software layers. The hardware, its firmware, the operating system, and the various software components used by a cloud application, all contribute to determining the energy footprint. Hence, even though increasing a data center efficiency will eventually improve energy efficiency, the internal design of cloud-based applications can be improved to lower energy consumption. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a RESTful multi-threaded application deployed in the cloud, to investigate the individual and the combined impact of three cloud patterns (e.g., Local Database proxy, Local Sharding Based Router and Priority Queue) on the energy consumption of cloud based applications. We measure the energy consumption using Power-API; an application programming interface (API) written in Java to monitor the energy consumed at the processlevel. Results show that cloud patterns can effectively reduce the energy consumption of a cloud application, but not in all cases. In general, there appear to be a trade-off between an improved response time of the application and the energy consumption. Developers and software architects can make use of these results to guide their design decisions.},

This opened the door for new possibilities but placed a new set of challenges that are to be faced by software developers, mainly when it comes to developing different applications in different programming languages and deploying them on various environments; often virtually hosted environments. The performance expectations and requirements might be easily affected by the settings of these virtual machines. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of these virtual environments and measure their impacts on the performance of multithreaded applications. In particular, we evaluate the performance of multithreaded applications and assess how it is influenced by the various virtualization technologies. A multithreaded application is developed in both C and Java and the performance is measured on different platforms; each of which is supported by either a virtualized system or a containerized environment. Certainly, C will keep outperforming Java in its execution speed; however, simple variations in the virtualization technique easily affects the performance of these multithreaded applications; a situation that should be taken into consideration by the software developers when deploying into such environments.},

The variation also manifests itself as frequency differences among processors under Turbo Boost dynamic overclocking. This variation can lead to unpredictable and suboptimal performance in tightly coupled HPC applications. In this study, we use compute-intensive kernels and applications to analyze the variation among processors in four top supercomputers: Edison, Cab, Stampede, and Blue Waters. We observe that there is an execution time difference of up to 16\% among processors on the Turbo Boost-enabled supercomputers: Edison, Cab, Stampede. There is less than 1\% variation on Blue Waters, which does not have a dynamic overclocking feature. We analyze measurements from temperature and power instrumentation and find that intrinsic differences in the chips' power efficiency is the culprit behind the frequency variation. Moreover, we analyze potential solutions such as disabling Turbo Boost, leaving idle cores and replacing slow chips to mitigate the variation. We also propose a speed-aware dynamic task redistribution (load balancing) algorithm to reduce the negative effects of performance variation. Our speedaware load balancing algorithm improves the performance up to 18\% compared to no load balancing performance and 6\% better than the non-speed aware counterpart.},

In order to address this issue, we exploit an approach, to empirically investigate the existing reward system practices, adopted on the crowdsourcing-based software development platforms, to motivate their developers and their perception. Subsequently, we implement a crawler to mine the characteristics of completed tasks and related reward information from the TopCoder platform of Tech Platform Inc (TPI). The promising results suggest the applicability of the proposed approach in order, 1) to investigate the reward system practices across the crowdsourcing-based platforms and, 2) to help the managers in formulating and implementing an effective reward system to incentivize their developers.},

	abstract     = {The Python programming language is becoming increasingly popular for scientific applications due to its simplicity, versatility, and the broad range of its libraries. A drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its low runtime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations and for the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics and cosmology. While various frameworks have been developed to address this limitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either force the user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of an optimised native compiled language. In order to combine the ease of Python and the speed of C++, we developed HOPE, a specialised Python just-in-time (JIT) compiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. HOPE focuses on a subset of the language and is able to translate Python code into C++ while performing numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. To enable the JIT compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to the function definition. We assess the performance of HOPE by performing a series of benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain Python, C++ and the other existing frameworks. We find that HOPE improves the performance compared to plain Python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable to that of C++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. We discuss the differences between HOPE and the other frameworks, as well as future extensions of its capabilities. The fully documented HOPE package is available at http://hope.phys.ethz.ch and is published under the GPLv3 license on PyPI and GitHub.},

However, much less attention has been given to coexistence of different secondary wireless technologies in the TV white spaces. Lack of coordination between secondary networks may create severe interference situations, resulting in less efficient usage of the spectrum. In this paper, we consider two of the most prominent wireless technologies available today, namely Long Term Evolution (LTE), and WiFi, and address some problems that arise from their coexistence in the same band. We perform exhaustive system simulations and observe that WiFi is hampered much more significantly than LTE in coexistence scenarios. A simple coexistence scheme that reuses the concept of almost blank subframes in LTE is proposed, and it is observed that it can improve the WiFi throughput per user up to 50 times in the studied scenarios.},

Recent studies indicate that energy consumption of mobile devices could be lowered by improving the quality of mobile apps. Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. We explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps. Refactoring of the code smells `Duplicated code' and `Type checking' reduce energy consumption by up to 10.8\%. Significant reduction in energy consumption, however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy consumption for the analyzed apps.},

	abstract     = {Randomized algorithms have been used to successfully address many different types of software engineering problems. This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However, randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the use of randomized algorithms in selected software engineering venues in 2009. Its goal is not to perform a complete survey but to get a representative snapshot of current practice in software engineering research. We show that randomized algorithms are used in a significant percentage of papers but that, in most cases, randomness is not properly accounted for. This casts doubts on the validity of most empirical results assessing randomized algorithms. There are numerous statistical tests, based on different assumptions, and it is not always clear when and how to use these tests. We hence provide practical guidelines to support empirical research on randomized algorithms in software engineering.},

First, portable program representations and dynamic language features, such as dynamic class loading, force the deferral of most optimizations until runtime, inducing runtime optimization overhead. Second, modular program representations preclude many forms of whole-program interprocedural optimization. Third, virtual machines incur additional costs for runtime services such as security guarantees and automatic memory management. To address these challenges, vendors have invested considerable resources into adaptive optimization systems in production virtual machines. Today, mainstream virtual machine implementations include substantial infrastructure for online monitoring and profiling, runtime compilation, and feedback-directed optimization. As a result, adaptive optimization has begun to mature as a widespread production-level technology. This paper surveys the evolution and current state of adaptive optimization technology in virtual machines.},

There are no recent estimations of the total energy consumption of the European data centre and of their energy efficiency. The aim of this paper is to evaluate, analyse and present the current trends in energy consumption and efficiency in data centres in the European Union using the data submitted by companies participating in the European Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency programme, a voluntary initiative created in 2008 in response to the increasing energy consumption in data centres and the need to reduce the related environmental, economic and energy supply security impacts. The analysis shows that the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of the facilities participating in the programme is declining year after year. This confirms that voluntary approaches could be effective in addressing climate and energy issue.},

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

	abstract     = {We attempt to apply the technique of Tracing JIT Compilers in the context of the PyPy project, i.e., to programs that are interpreters for some dynamic languages, including Python. Tracing JIT compilers can greatly speed up programs that spend most of their time in loops in which they take similar code paths. However, applying an unmodified tracing JIT to a program that is itself a bytecode interpreter results in very limited or no speedup. In this paper we show how to guide tracing JIT compilers to greatly improve the speed of bytecode interpreters. One crucial point is to unroll the bytecode dispatch loop, based on two kinds of hints provided by the implementer of the bytecode interpreter. We evaluate our technique by applying it to two PyPy interpreters: one is a small example, and the other one is the full Python interpreter.},

	author       = {Boussaa, Mohamed},
	year         = 2017,
	month        = sep,
	abstract     = {Generative software development has paved the way for the creation of multiple generators (code generators and compilers) that serve as a basis for automatically producing code to a broad range of software and hardware platforms. With full automatic code generation, users are able to rapidly synthesize software artifacts for various software platforms. In addition, they can easily customize the generated code for the target hardware platform since modern generators (i.e., C compilers) become highly configurable, offering numerous configuration options that the user can apply. Consequently, the quality of generated software becomes highly correlated to the configuration settings as well as to the generator itself. In this context, it is crucial to verify the correct behavior of generators. Numerous approaches have been proposed to verify the functional outcome of generated code but few of them evaluate the non-functional properties of automatically generated code, namely the performance and resource usage properties. This thesis addresses three problems : (1) Non-functional testing of generators: We benefit from the existence of multiple code generators with comparable functionality (i.e., code generator families) to automatically test the generated code. We leverage the metamorphic testing approach to detect non-functional inconsistencies in code generator families by defining metamorphic relations as test oracles. We define the metamorphic relation as a comparison between the variations of performance and resource usage of code, generated from the same code generator family. We evaluate our approach by analyzing the performance of HAXE, a popular code generator family. Experimental results show that our approach is able to automatically detect several inconsistencies that reveal real issues in this family of code generators. (2) Generators auto-tuning: We exploit the recent advances in search-based software engineering in order to provide an effective approach to tune generators (i.e., through optimizations) according to user's non-functional requirements (i.e., performance and resource usage). We also demonstrate that our approach can be used to automatically construct optimization levels that represent optimal trade-offs between multiple non-functional properties such as execution time and resource usage requirements. We evaluate our approach by verifying the optimizations performed by the GCC compiler. Our experimental results show that our approach is able to auto-tune compilers and construct optimizations that yield to better performance results than standard optimization levels. (3) Handling the diversity of software and hardware platforms in software testing: Running tests and evaluating the resource usage in heterogeneous environments is tedious. To handle this problem, we benefit from the recent advances in lightweight system virtualization, in particular container-based virtualization, in order to offer effective support for automatically deploying, executing, and monitoring code in heterogeneous environment, and collect non-functional metrics (e.g., memory and CPU consumptions). This testing infrastructure serves as a basis for evaluating the experiments conducted in the two first contributions.},

	abstract     = {Reducing computational energy consumption is of growing importance, particularly at the extremes (i.e., mobile devices and datacentres). Despite the ubiquity of the Java virtual machine (JVM), very little work has been done to apply search-based software engineering (SBSE) to minimize the energy consumption of programs that run on it. We describe OPACITOR, a tool for measuring the energy consumption of JVM programs using a bytecode level model of energy cost. This has several advantages over timebased energy approximations or hardware measurements. It is 1) deterministic, 2) unaffected by the rest of the computational environment, 3) able to detect small changes in execution profile, making it highly amenable to metaheuristic search, which requires locality of representation. We show how generic SBSE approaches coupled with OPACITOR achieve substantial energy savings for three widely used software components. Multilayer perceptron implementations minimizing both energy and error were found, and energy reductions of up to 70\% and 39.85\% were obtained over the original code for Quicksort and object-oriented container classes, respectively. These highlight three important considerations for automatically reducing computational energy: tuning software to particular distributions of data; trading off energy use against functional properties; and handling internal dependencies that can exist within software that render simple sweeps over program variants sub-optimal. Against these, global search greatly simplifies the developer's job, freeing development time for other tasks.},

In order to validate our framework and show how accurate it executes, a performance comparison has been done. We analyzed the details of a commercial proxy cache system and compare its results with those obtained from our simulator using the most commonly replacement algorithm (LRU). For this purpose, the proposed environment was adapted to match the performance of the real proxy cache. Experimental results show that proxy cache hit ratio deviations fall very close to the real system, since then, never exceeds 3.42\%.},

However, while power capping ensures a system will never exceed a given power limit, it also leads to a new form of heterogeneity: natural manufacturing variability, which was previously hidden by varying power to achieve homogeneous performance, now results in heterogeneous performance caused by different CPU frequencies, potentially for each core, to enforce the power limit.},

Most previous studies rely on the Clean Program Assumption, that a test suite will obtain similar coverage for both faulty and fixed ('clean') program versions. This assumption may appear intuitive, especially for bugs that denote small semantic deviations. However, we present evidence that the Clean Program Assumption does not always hold, thereby raising a critical threat to the validity of previous results. We then conducted a study using a robust experimental methodology that avoids this threat to validity, from which our primary finding is that strong mutation testing has the highest fault revelation of four widely-used criteria. Our findings also revealed that fault revelation starts to increase significantly only once relatively high levels of coverage are attained.},

Different testing techniques are developed for testing compilers automatically. However, it is unknown so far how these testing techniques compared to each other in terms of testing effectiveness: how many bugs a testing technique can find within a time limit. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive empirical comparison of three compiler testing techniques, namely, Randomized Differential Testing (RDT), a variant of RDT---Different Optimization Levels (DOL), and Equivalence Modulo Inputs (EMI). Our results show that DOL is more effective at detecting bugs related to optimization, whereas RDT is more effective at detecting other types of bugs, and the three techniques can complement each other to a certain degree. Furthermore, in order to understand why their effectiveness differs, we investigate three factors that influence the effectiveness of compiler testing, namely, efficiency, strength of test oracles, and effectiveness of generated test programs. The results indicate that all the three factors are statistically significant, and efficiency has the most significant impact.},

Energy is evidently one of the most critical resources for such devices, in spite of the substantial gain in popularity of mobile devices, such as smart phones, their utility is severely constrained by the bounded battery capacity. Mobile users are very interested in accessing the Internet although it is one of the most expensive operations in terms of energy and cost. HTTP/2 has been proposed and accepted as the new standard for supporting the World Wide Web. HTTP/2 is expected to offer better performance, such as reduced page load time. Consequently, from the mobile users point of view, the question arises:does HTTP/2 offer improved energy consumption performance achieving longer battery life?In this paper, we compare the energy consumption of HTTP/2 with its predecessor (i.e., HTTP/1.1) using a variety of realworld and synthetic test scenarios. We also investigate how Transport Layer Security (TLS) impacts the energy consumption of the mobile devices. Our study suggests that Round Trip Time (RTT) is one of the biggest factors in deciding how advantageous HTTP/2 is compared to HTTP/1.1. We conclude that for networks with higher RTTs, HTTP/2 has better energy consumption performance than HTTP/1.1.},

	abstract     = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application. In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10\% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

	abstract     = {Energy-efficient computing is becoming increasingly important. Among the reasons, one can mention the massive consumption of large data centers that consume as much as 180,000 homes. This trend, combined with environmental concerns, makes energy efficiency a prime technological and societal challenge. Currently, widely used power distribution units (PDUs) are often shared amongst nodes to deliver aggregated power consumption reports, in the range of hours and minutes. However, in order to improve the energy efficiency of software systems, we need to support process-level power estimation in real-time, which goes beyond the capacity of a PDUs. In particular, the CPU is considered by the research community as the major power consumer within a node and draws attention while trying to model the system power consumption. Over the last few years, a dozen of ad hoc power models have been proposed to cope with the wide diversity and the growing complexity of modern CPU architectures. In this thesis, we rather propose PowerAPI for learning power models and building software-defined power meters that provide accurate power estimation on modern architectures. With the emergence of cloud computing, we propose BitWatts and WattsKit for leveraging software power estimation in VMs and clusters. A finer level of estimation may be required to further evaluate the effectiveness of the software optimizations and we therefore propose codEnergy for helping developers to understand how the energy is really consumed by a software. We deeply assessed all above approaches, thus demonstrating the usefulness of PowerAPI to better understand the software power consumption on modern architectures.},

The use of static analysis tools might be employed to mitigate these problems by assisting the detection of recurring design violations in a given architectural pattern. In this work, we present MTV-Checker, a tool to assist the automatic detection of 5 design violations in Django-based web applications. We also conducted an empirical study in the context of the SUAP system, a large-scale Django-based information system with more than 175.000 lines of Python code currently deployed in more than 30 Brazilian institutions. Our results present the most recurrent violations, how they evolve along software evolution, and the opinions and experiences of software architects regarding these violations.},

	abstract     = {Mobile and wearable devices are nowadays the de facto personal computers, while desktop computers are becoming less popular. Therefore, it is important for companies to deliver efficient mobile applications. As an example, Google has published a set of best practices to optimize the performance of Android applications. However, these guidelines fall short to address energy consumption. As mobile software applications operate in resource-constrained environments, guidelines to build energy efficient applications are of utmost importance. In this paper, we studied whether or not a set of best performance-based practices have an impact on the energy consumed by Android applications. In an experimental study with six popular mobile applications, we observed that the battery of the mobile device can last up to approximately an extra hour if the applications are developed with energy-aware practices. This work paves the way for a set of guidelines for energy-aware automatic refactoring techniques.},

Energy consumption models are pivotal in designing and optimizing energy-efficient operations to curb excessive energy consumption in data centers. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art techniques used for energy consumption modeling and prediction for data centers and their components. We conduct an in-depth study of the existing literature on data center power modeling, covering more than 200 models. We organize these models in a hierarchical structure with two main branches focusing on hardware-centric and software-centric power models. Under hardware-centric approaches we start from the digital circuit level and move on to describe higher-level energy consumption models at the hardware component level, server level, data center level, and finally systems of systems level. Under the software-centric approaches we investigate power models developed for operating systems, virtual machines and software applications. This systematic approach allows us to identify multiple issues prevalent in power modeling of different levels of data center systems, including: i) few modeling efforts targeted at power consumption of the entire data center ii) many state-of-the-art power models are based on a few CPU or server metrics, and iii) the effectiveness and accuracy of these power models remain open questions. Based on these observations, we conclude the survey by describing key challenges for future research on constructing effective and accurate data center power models.},

We selected ten Java projects from the Java Qualitas Corpus and ten projects written in Python. For each system, we considered 10 class-level software metrics. We performed a best fit procedure on the empirical distributions through the log-normal distribution and the double Pareto distribution to identify differences between the two languages. Even though the statistical distributions for projects written in Java and Python may appear the same for lower values of the metric, performing the procedure with the double Pareto distribution for the Number of Local Methods metric reveals that major differences can be noticed along the queue of the distributions. On the contrary, the same analysis performed with the Number of Statements metric reveals that only the initial portion of the double Pareto distribution shows differences between the two languages. In addition, the dispersion parameter associated to the log-normal distribution fit for the total Number Of Methods can be used for distinguishing Java projects from Python projects.},

These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

Hence, we propose an experimental methodology to understand such differences. We show that CPUs are responsible for such heterogeneity which can reach 20\% in terms of energy consumption. So energy aware (Green) schedulers must take care of such hidden heterogeneity in order to propose efficient mapping of tasks. To consume less energy, we propose an energy-aware scheduling approach taking into account the heterogeneous idle power consumption of homogeneous nodes. It shows that we are able to save energy up to 17\% while exploiting the high power heterogeneity that may exist in some homogeneous clusters.},

This spurred the growth of systems like Docker that enable single hosts to isolate several applications, similar to VMs, within a low-overhead OPTabstraction called containers. Motivation: Although containers tout low overhead performance, how much do they increase energy use? Methodology: This work statistically compares the energy consumption of three application workloads in Docker and on bare-metal Linux. Results: In all cases, there was a statistically significant (t-test and Wilcoxon p {$<$} .05) increase in energy consumption when running tests in Docker, mostly due to the performance of I/O system calls. Developers worried about I/O overhead could consider baremetal deployments over Docker container deployments.},

	abstract     = {In recent years we have seen an explosion of markets for portable electronic devices such as PDAs, personal communicators and mobile phones. The size and complexity of applications, but also development constraints like getting the product to market on time make the use of high-level languages like Java necessary. Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) has emerged as a good solution for developing applications on those platforms. The main goal of Java language is to allow applications development with an abstraction of the target platform, making the concept ``write once, run it anywhere'' possible. The Java Virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract machine, making the interface between platform independent applications and the hardware, through a possible operating system. Thus the use of Java language can be seen as adding one more layer, the Java virtual machine, between the hardware and software layers. In this paper we establish a general framework for estimating the energy consumption of an embedded Java virtual machine. We have designed a number of experiments to find the constants overhead of the Virtual Machine and establish energy consumption cost for individual Java Opcodes. The results show that there is a basic constant overhead that is equal for every Java program, and a that a subset of Java opcodes have an almost constant energy cost. We also show that memory access is a crucial energy consumption component.},

Such many servers consume a significant amount of energy, mostly accountable to their CPUs, but they are necessary to ensure low latencies, since users expect sub-second response times (e.g., 500 ms). However, users can hardly notice response times that are faster than their expectations. Hence, we propose the Predictive Energy Saving Online Scheduling Algorithm (PESOS) to select the most appropriate CPU frequency to process a query on a per-core basis. PESOS aim at process queries by their deadlines and leverage high-level scheduling information to reduce the CPU energy consumption of a query processing node. PESOS base its decision on query efficiency predictors, estimating the processing volume and processing time of a query. We experimentally evaluate PESOS upon the TREC ClueWeb09B collection and the MSN2006 query log. Results show that PESOS can reduce the CPU energy consumption of a query processing node up to {$\sim$}48\% compared to a system running at maximum CPU core frequency. PESOS outperform also the best state of the-art competitor with a {$\sim$}20\% energy saving, while the competitor requires a fine parameter tuning and it may incur in uncontrollable latency violations.},

To explain the results, we explored the memory usage and the bytecode executed during an operation. Expensive computation tasks in the analyzed bytecode traces appeared to have an energy impact, but memory usage did not contribute. We evaluated our profiles by using them to selectively replace Collections types used in six applications and libraries. We found that choosing the wrong Collections type, as indicated by our profiles, can cost even 300\% more energy than the most efficient choice. Our work shows that the usage context of a data structure and our measured energy profiles can be used to decide between alternative Collections implementations.},

To fully realize the cost benefits of cloud services, users usually need to reliably know the execution performance of their applications. However, due to the random performance fluctuations experienced by cloud applications, the black box nature of public clouds and the cloud usage costs, testing on clouds to acquire accurate performance results is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a novel cloud performance testing methodology called PT4Cloud. By employing non-parametric statistical approaches of likelihood theory and the bootstrap method, PT4Cloud provides reliable stop conditions to obtain highly accurate performance distributions with confidence bands. These statistical approaches also allow users to specify intuitive accuracy goals and easily trade between accuracy and testing cost. We evaluated PT4Cloud with 33 benchmark configurations on Amazon Web Service and Chameleon clouds. When compared with performance data obtained from extensive performance tests, PT4Cloud provides testing results with 95.4\% accuracy on average while reducing the number of test runs by 62\%. We also propose two test execution reduction techniques for PT4Cloud, which can reduce the number of test runs by 90.1\% while retaining an average accuracy of 91\%. We compared our technique to three other techniques and found that our results are much more accurate.},

Simulation is a popular approach for studying the behavior of HPC applications in a variety of scenarios. However, simulators are infrequently able to provide faithful performance predictions of applications and typically lack the capability of providing details about the energy consumption of the simulated platforms, especially when comprised of multi-core architectures. Furthermore, studying the impact of different application configurations on energy consumption is a difficult task as only few platforms are equipped with proper power measurement devices. In this paper, we present an extension of the SimGrid simulation toolkit that OPTaddresses these challenges. We firstly introduce a model for application energy consumption that supports dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) of simulated processors. Secondly, we discuss means to account for coarse-grain memory effects in multi-core architectures. The advantages of our approach, compared to cycle-level simulators, are faster simulation run times and enhanced scalability with, provided the target platform is correctly modeled, a retained excellent accuracy. We discuss our model in detail and demonstrate how it can be instantiated by profiling different applications during the calibration phase. Finally, the proposed simulator is validated through an extensive set of experiments with common HPC benchmarks.},

Then, they must aggregate these measurements to estimate the energy consumed by the tests for each software revision. This is time consuming and is made more difficult by the constraints of mobile devices and their OSes. In this paper we propose, implement, and demonstrate Green Miner: the first dedicated hardware mining software repositories testbed. The Green Miner physically measures the energy consumption of mobile devices (Android phones) and automates the testing of applications, and the reporting of measurements back to developers and researchers.

In this paper, we tackle the first three of these goals and describe the instrumentation of two high-end compute nodes with three different current measurement techniques: (i) Hall effect sensors, (ii) measuring shunts in extension cables and riser cards, and (iii) tapping into the voltage regulators. The resulting measurement data for components such as sockets, PCIe cards, and DRAM DIMMs is digitized at sampling rates from 7 kSa/s up to 500 kSa/s, enabling a fine-grained correlation between power usage and application events. The accuracy of all elements in the measurement infrastructure is studied carefully. Moreover, potential pitfalls in building custom power instrumentation are discussed. We raise the awareness for the properties of power measurements, as disregarding existing inaccuracies can lead to invalid conclusions regarding energy efficiency.},

	abstract     = {Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been the cornerstone of innumerable software approaches to meeting application timing requirements with minimal energy. However, recent trends in technology-e.g., moving voltage converters on chip-favor hardware control of DVFS, as hardware can both react faster to external events and perform fine-grained power management across a device. We respond to these trends with CoPPer, which instead uses hardware power capping to meet application performance requirements with high energy efficiency. We find that meeting performance requirements with power capping is more challenging than using DVFS because the relationship between power and performance is non-linear and has diminishing returns at high power values. CoPPer overcomes these difficulties by using adaptive control to approximate non-linearities and a novel gain limit to avoid over-allocating power when it is no longer beneficial. We evaluate CoPPer with 20 parallel applications and compare it to both a classic linear DVFS controller and to a sophisticated control-theoretic, model-driven software DVFS manager. CoPPer provides all the functionality of the sophisticated DVFS-based approach, without requiring a user-specified model or time-consuming, exhaustive application/system pre-characterization. Compared to DVFS, CoPPer's gain limit reduces energy by 6\% on average and by 12\% for memory-bound applications. For high performance requirements, the energy savings are even greater: 8\% on average and 18\% for memory-bound applications.},

While a valuable resource, the state of the art PyPI search has very limited capabilities, making it hard for developers to find useful, high quality Python code to use for their task at hand. We introduce SPYSE (Semantic PYthon Search Engine), a web-based search engine that overcomes the limitations of the state of the art, making it easier for developers to find useful code. The power of SPYSE lays in the combination of three different aspects meant to provide developers with relevant, and at the same time high quality code: code semantics, popularity, and code quality. SPYSE also allows searching for modules, in addition to packages, which opens new reuse opportunities for developers, currently not supported.

We present a first-of-its-kind study on manufacturing variability on four production HPC systems spanning four microarchitectures, analyze its impact on HPC applications, and propose a novel variation-aware power budgeting scheme to maximize effective application performance. Our low-cost and scalable budgeting algorithm strives to achieve performance homogeneity under a power constraint by deriving application-specific, module-level power allocations. Experimental results using a 1,920 socket system show up to 5.4X speedup, with an average speedup of 1.8X across all benchmarks when compared to a variation-unaware power allocation scheme.},

	abstract     = {In the quest for energy efficiency of Information and Communication Technology, so far research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, as hardware technology becomes more sophisticated, the role of software becomes crucial. Recently, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, measuring the energy consumption of software has proven to be a challenge, due to the large number of variables that need to be controlled to obtain reliable measurements. Due to cost and time constraints, many software product organizations are unable to effectively measure the energy consumption of software. This prevents them to be in control over the energy efficiency of their products. In this paper, we propose a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a software product across different releases, from the perspective of a software organization. Our method allows to attribute differences in energy consumption to changes in the software. We validate our profiling method through an empirical experiment on two consecutive releases of a commercial software product. We demonstrate how the method can be applied by organizations and provide an analysis of the software related changes in energy consumption. Our results show that, despite a lack of precise measurements, energy consumption differences between releases of a software product can be quantified down to the level of individual processes. Additionally, the results provide insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption.},

As with all measurements, repeatability and reproducibility of power measurements are a major challenge. Nominally identical systems can have different power con- sumption running the same workload under otherwise iden- tical conditions.  This behavior can also be observed for in- dividual system components.  Specifically, CPU power con- sumption can vary amongst different samples of nominally identical CPUs.  This in turn has a significant impact on the overall  system  power,  considering  that  a  system's  proces- sor is the largest and most dynamic power consumer of the overall system.  The concrete impact of CPU sample power variations is unknown, as comprehensive studies about dif- ferences in power consumption for nominally identical sys- tems are currently missing. We  OPTaddress  this  lack  of  studies  by  conducting  measure- ments  on  four  different  processor  types  from  two  different architectures.   For  each  of  these  types,  we  compare  up  to 30 physical processor samples with a total sum of 90 sam- ples over all processor types.  We analyze the variations in power consumption for the different samples using six dif- ferent workloads over five load levels.  Additionally, we ana- lyze how these variations change for different processor core counts and architectures. The results of this paper show that selection of a processor sample can have a statistically significant impact on power consumption.   With  no  correlation  to  performance,  power consumption for nominally identical processors can differ as much as 29.6\% in idle and 19.5\% at full load.  We also show that these variations change over different architectures and processor types.},

Refactoring is a change made to the internal structure of a software component to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify, without changing the observable behaviour of that software component. Bad smells indicate that there is something wrong in the code that have to refactor. There are different tools that are available to identify and remove these bad smells. It is a technique that change our source code in a more readable and maintainable form by removing the bad smells from the code. Refactoring is used to improve the quality of software by reducing the complexity. In this paper bad smells are found and perform the refactoring based on these bad smell and then find the complexity of program and compare with initial complexity. This paper shows that when refactoring is performed the complexity of software decrease and easily understandable.},

One of its implications is that optimization of an application for performance will also optimize it for energy. In this work, we show that energy proportionality does not hold true for multicore CPUs. This finding creates the opportunity for bi-objective optimization of applications for performance and energy. We propose and study the first application-level method for bi-objective optimization of multithreaded data-parallel applications for performance and energy. The method uses two decision variables, the number of identical multithreaded kernels (threadgroups) executing the application and the number of threads in each threadgroup, so that a given workload is partitioned equally between the threadgroups. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the method using four highly optimized multithreaded data-parallel applications, 2D fast Fourier transform based on FFTW and Intel MKL, and dense matrix-matrix multiplication using OpenBLAS and Intel MKL. Four modern multicore CPUs are used in the experiments. The experiments show that the optimization for performance alone results in the increase in dynamic energy consumption by up to 89\% and optimization for dynamic energy alone results in performance degradation by up to 49\%. By solving the bi-objective optimization problem, the method determines up to 11 globally Pareto-optimal solutions.},

In the rst step, discrepant pairs of code sections in the assembly codes are extracted, and then the sums of the weights of discrepant instructions in the sections are computed. If signi cant di erences are detected, the test program is reduced to a small program that still exhibits the static di erence and then the actual execution time of the codes are compared. A test system has been implemented on top of the random test system Orange4, which has successfully detected a regression in the optimizer of a development version of GCC-8.0.0 (latest as of May, 2017).},

Dynamic adaptation of hardware techniques such as fine-grain clock gating, power gating and dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, are used for many years to improve the computer's energy efficiency. However, recent demands of exascale computation, as well as the increasing carbon footprint, require new breakthrough to make ICT systems more energy efficient. Energy efficient software has not been well studied in the last decade. In this paper, we take an early step to investigate the energy efficiency of Java which is one of the most common languages used in ICT systems. We evaluate energy consumption of data types, operators, control statements, exception, and object in Java at a granular level. Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) technology is applied to measure the relative power consumption of small code snippets. Several observations are found, and these results will help in standardizing the energy consumption traits of Java which can be leveraged by software developers to generate energy efficient code in future.},

An in-depth comparative study is conducted by developing a functionally-equivalent web application using each of the two frameworks as well as plain PHP (no framework).

We present the largest to date quantitative and qualitative empirical investigation into the categories of API calls and usage patterns that\textemdash in the context of the Android development framework\textemdash exhibit particularly high energy consumption profiles. By using a hardware power monitor, we measure energy consumption of method calls when executing typical usage scenarios in 55 mobile apps from different domains. Based on the collected data, we mine and analyze energy-greedy APIs and usage patterns. We zoom in and discuss the cases where either the anomalous energy consumption is unavoidable or where it is due to suboptimal usage or choice of APIs. Finally, we synthesize our findings into actionable knowledge and recipes for developers on how to reduce energy consumption while using certain categories of Android APIs and patterns.},

In this paper, we illuminate the optimization space of application-level energy management, from a novel data-oriented perspective. First, we study the varying energy impacts of alternative data management choices by programmers, such as data access patterns, data precision choices, and data organization. Second, we attempt to build a bridge between application-level energy management and hardware-level energy management, by elucidating how various application-level features respond to Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), arguably the most classic hardware-based energy management approach. Finally, we apply our findings to real-world applications, demonstrating their potential for greater energy savings. The empirical study is particularly relevant in the Big Data era, where dataintensive applications are large energy consumers, and their energy efficiency is strongly correlated to how data are maintained and handled in programs.},

Yet, energy-driven research has mostly focused on the hardware and middleware layers, but few efforts target the application level, where many energy-aware optimizations are possible. We revisit a catalog of Java primitives commonly used in OO scientific programming, or micro-benchmarks, to identify energy-friendly versions of the same primitive. We then apply the micro-benchmarks to classical scientific application kernels and machine learning algorithms for both single-thread and multi-thread implementations on a server. Energy usage reductions at the micro-benchmark level are substantial, while for applications obtained reductions range from 3.90\% to 99.18\%.},

Containers emerge as the most appropriate way for agile software development, packaging, shipping and deployment across heterogeneous IT environments (local servers, cloud servers, personal devices, etc.). The software portability being achieved through the containerization movement is being applauded by business houses and IT industry professionals. Containers are being touted as the viable alternative to virtual machines, which are verbose and bulky. The faster provisioning, the real-time scalability, and quick transmission of application containers are being pronounced as the key differentiators of the containerization paradigm. With a growing array of enabling tools from various product vendors, the realization of containerized cloud environments is picking up fast. The DevOps concept gets strengthened with the faster maturity and stability of the Docker platform. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same application, unchanged, on laptops, data centre VMs, and any cloud. In this paper, the integration of Docker containers with the monitoring tool ``Sysdig'' (https://sysdig.com/) is explained.

These decisions may impact the application in terms of efficiency, usability, flexibility, etc. Different competing design decisions are therefore often evaluated in terms of their projected impact on quality metrics prior to implementation. Recently energy has become a concern for software systems, ranging from mobile devices to large data centers. Additionally, it has been recognized that the software executing on a computing device can have a significant impact on the device's energy consumption. This raises the obvious question of whether or not it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a software system by the means of software design decisions. This work examines how the use of different servers impacts the energy consumption of a web application. Through a controlled empirical experiment we have discovered several important findings in this regard. The results indicate that the energy consumption of a web application can vary greatly depending on the web server used to handle its requests. Furthermore, different web servers are more or less energy efficient depending on which web application features are being executed. The paper details an analysis of the results of the experiment.},

Consequently, processor performance variation has been considered to be a secondary issue in the broader problem of performance characterization. In this work, we present an empirical survey of the variation in processor performance and energy efficiency on several generations of HPC-grade Intel processors. Our study shows that, compared to the previous generation of Intel processors, the problem of performance variation has become worse on more recent generation of Intel processors. Specifically, the performance variation across processors on a large-scale production HPC cluster at LLNL has increased to 20\% and the runto-run variation in the performance of individual processors has increased to 15\%. We show that this variation is further magnified under a hardware-enforced power constraint, potentially due to the increase in number of cores, inconsistencies in the chip manufacturing process and their combined impact on processor's energy management functionality. Our experimentation with a hardwareenforced processor power constraint shows that the variation in processor performance and energy efficiency has increased by up to 4x on the latest Intel processors.},

Nonetheless, the question about relative performance comes up repeatedly in the research community, industry, and wider audience of enthusiasts. This paper presents 14 benchmarks and a novel methodology to assess the compiler effectiveness across language implementations. Using a set of common language abstractions, the benchmarks are implemented in Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Crystal, Newspeak, and Smalltalk. We show that the benchmarks exhibit a wide range of characteristics using language-agnostic metrics. Using four different languages on top of the same compiler, we show that the benchmarks perform similarly and therefore allow for a comparison of compiler effectiveness across languages. Based on anecdotes, we argue that these benchmarks help language implementers to identify performance bugs and optimization potential by comparing to other language implementations.},

To meet these new requirements while maintaining critical support for low energy operation, a new multiprocessor node hardware and software architecture, low power energy aware Processing (LEAP), has been developed. The LEAP architecture integrates fine-grained energy dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power control scheduling for all subsystems including sensor subsystems. The LEAP2 platform is a second generation LEAP system with even higher resolution energy monitoring as well as the unique ability to do per process and per application energy profiling via a dedicated high performance ASIC. Our demonstration will highlight this profiling capability through a custom monitoring application named etop.},

However, a gap in the existing research on containers exists in the area of power consumption. This paper presents the results of a performance comparison in terms of power consumption of four different virtualization technologies: KVM and Xen, which are based on hypervisor virtualization, Docker and LXC which are based on container virtualization. The aim of this empirical investigation, carried out by means of a testbed, is to understand how these technologies react to particular workloads. Our initial results show how, despite of the number of virtual entities running, both kinds of virtualization alternatives behave similarly in idle state and in CPU/Memory stress test. Contrarily, the results on network performance show differences between the two technologies.},

Energy efficiency metrics and benchmarks are also provided so that operators can use these information to track the performance of and identify opportunities to reduce energy use of air conditioning systems in their data centers. The collected data from articles and reports show that the average of HVAC system effectiveness index is 1.44. More than half of the data centers' air conditioning systems are inefficient. In total, HVAC systems account for about 38\% of facility energy consumption. The range for this usage was 21\% for the most efficient system and 61\% for the least efficient system. Moreover it would be necessary to review some currently available energy efficiency strategies such as economizer cycles, airflow optimization, energy management, and simulations tools.},

In this paper, we therefore report on a runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to easily report on the energy consumption of system processes. Concretely, our approach adopts an OS-level library, called PowerAPI, which estimates the power consumption of processes according to different dimensions (CPU, network, etc.). In order to better understand potential energy leaks of legacy software, we use this library to study the impact of programming languages and algorithmic choices on the energy consumption. This preliminary study is based on an empirical evaluation of a eight implementations of the Towers of Hanoi problem.},

Model-based techniques require a possibly difficult calibration of the parameters needed to correctly create a model on a specific hardware device. Finally, software-based solutions are easier to use, but they are possibly less precise than hardware-based solution. In this demo, we present PETrA, a novel software-based tool for measuring the energy consumption of Android apps.

However, developers still lack the knowledge and the tools to support them in that task. In this work, we explore our vision that energy consumption non-specialists can build software that consumes less energy by alternating, at development time, between thirdparty, readily available, diversely-designed pieces of software, without increasing the development complexity. To support our vision, we propose an approach for energy-aware development that combines the construction of application-independent energy profiles of Java collections and static analysis to produce an estimate of in which ways and how intensively a system employs these collections. By combining these two pieces of information, it is possible to produce energy-saving recommendations for alternative collection implementations to be used in different parts of the system. We implement this approach in a tool named CT+ that works with both desktop and mobile Java systems, and is capable of analyzing 40 different collection implementations of lists, maps, and sets. We applied CT+ to twelve software systems: two mobile-based, seven desktop-based, and three that can run in both environments. Our evaluation infrastructure involved a high-end server, a notebook, and three mobile devices. When applying the (mostly trivial) recommendations, we achieved up to 17.34\% reduction in energy consumption just by replacing collection implementations. Even for a real world, mature, highlyoptimized system such as Xalan, CT+ could achieve a 5.81\% reduction in energy consumption. Our results indicate that some widely used collections, e.g., ArrayList, HashMap, and HashTable, are not energy-efficient and sometimes should be avoided when energy consumption is a major concern.},

Nevertheless, measuring the energy consumption of a software system remains a tedious task for practitioners. In particular, the energy measurement process may be subject to a lot of variations that hinder the relevance of potential comparisons. While the state of the art mostly acknowledged the impact of hardware factors (chip printing process, CPU temperature), this paper investigates the impact of controllable factors on these variations. More specifically, we conduct an empirical study of multiple controllable parameters that one can easily tune to tame the energy consumption variations when benchmarking software systems. To better understand the causes of such variations, we ran more than a 1,000 experiments on more than 100 nodes with different workloads and configurations. The main factors we studied encompass: experimental protocol, CPU features (C-states, Turbo~Boost, core pinning) and generations, as well as the operating system. Our experiments showed that, for some workloads, it is possible to tighten the energy variation by up to 30x. Finally, we summarize our results as guidelines to tame energy consumption variations. We argue that the guidelines we deliver are the minimal requirements to be considered prior to any energy efficiency evaluation.},

	abstract     = {Context Dynamic languages have turned out to be suitable for developing specific applications where runtime adaptability is an important issue. Although .Net and Java platforms have gradually incorporated features to improve their support of dynamic languages, they do not provide intercession for every object or class. This limitation is mainly caused by the rigid class-based object model these platforms implement, in contrast to the flexible prototype-based model used by most dynamic languages. Objective Our approach is to provide intercession for any object or class by defining a hybrid class- and prototype-based object model that efficiently incorporates structural intercession into the object model implemented by the widespread .Net and Java platforms. Method In a previous work, we developed and evaluated an extension of a shared-source implementation of the .Net platform. In this work, we define the formal semantics of the proposed reflective model, and modify the existing implementation to include the hybrid model. Finally, we assess its runtime performance and memory consumption, comparing it to existing approaches. Results Our platform shows a competitive runtime performance compared to 9 widespread systems. On average, it performs 73\% and 61\% better than the second fastest system for short- and long-running applications, respectively. Besides, it is the JIT-compiler approach that consumes less average memory. The proposed approach of including a hybrid object-model into the virtual machine involves a 444\% performance improvement (and 65\% less memory consumption) compared to the existing alternative of creating an extra software layer (the DLR). When none of the new features are used, our platform requires 12\% more execution time and 13\% more memory than the original .Net implementation. Conclusion Our proposed hybrid class- and prototype-based object model supports structural intercession for any object or class. It can be included in existing JIT-compiler class-based platforms to support common dynamic languages, providing competitive runtime performance and low memory consumption.},

However, there are other efforts to improve software qualities like performance or reliability as well as maintainability by using code refactoring techniques.

This paper aims to investigate whether the existing refactoring techniques can support energy-efficient software generation or not. The refactored codes generated by the existing techniques can consume more power than original codes because they did not consider the power consumption in their refactoring processes. This paper analyzes the power consumption to investigate the energy efficiency of M. Fowler's refactoring techniques. Our analysis result can provide useful information about energy-efficient refactoring techniques to software engineers, and support the development of software that has high maintainability and good energy efficiency.},

Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption problems: the questions they ask are not only diverse -- we found 5 main themes of questions -- but also often more interesting and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers. In addition, we observed that some of these answers are often flawed or vague. We contrast the advice provided by these answers with the state-of-the-art research on energy consumption.

However, current state-of-the-Art does not provide empirically-validated guidelines for developing energy-efficient software. Aim. This study aims at assessing the impact, in terms of energy savings, of best practices for achieving software energy efficiency, elicited from previous work. By doing so, it identifies which resources are affected by the practices and the possible trade-offs with energy consumption. Method. We performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment, where we applied two different Green Software practices to two software applications, namely query optimization in MySQL Server and usage of ``sleep'' instruction in the Apache web server. We then performed a comparison of the energy consumption at system-level and at resource-level, before and after applying the practice. Results. Our results show that both practices are effective in improving software energy efficiency, reducing consumption up to 25\%. We observe that after applying the practices, resource usage is more energy-proportional i.e., increasing CPU usage increases energy consumption in an almost linear way. We also provide our reflections on empirical experimentation in software energy efficiency. Conclusions. Our contribution shows that significant improvements in software energy efficiency can be gained by applying best practices during design and development. Future work will be devoted to further validate best practices, and to improve their reusability.},

Our response variables were execution time and energy consumption. Results. As expected, pure SQL yielded the best performance and energy efficiency in all test cases. Propel exhibited a much higher energy consumption and longer execution times. The TinyQueries tool performed slightly worse than SQL, but significantly better than Propel, offering a convenient trade\textendash off between ORM benefits and energy efficiency. Conclusions. Our experiment shows that ORM approaches have a significant impact on both energy consumption and performance. This helps developers and architects when considering the trade-off between their benefits (e.g. in terms of code maintainability and readability) and drawbacks.},

This research evaluated how different container platforms (Docker, LXC, and LXD) impacted in running different TCP services and also measured system performance of each container compared to the native system without any container solution based on overall performance metrics. This research focuses on the three most used PaaS: FTP server, web server, and mail server. related to previous works, our evaluation results show that performance could vary between containers. In terms of system performance, LXD shows better performance while server performance result varies depending on what service is being evaluated.},

In 1999, Refactoring revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly anticipated Refactoring to Patterns, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring.This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.Coverage includes: A catalog of twenty-seven pattern-directed refactorings, featuring real-world code examples Descriptions of twelve design smells that indicate the need for this book's refactorings General information and new insights about patterns and refactoring Detailed implementation mechanics: how low-level refactorings are combined to implement high-level patterns Multiple ways to implement the same pattern-and when to use each Practical ways to get started even if you have little experience with patterns or refactoringRefactoring to Patterns reflects three years of refinement and the insights of more than sixty software engineering thought leaders in the global patterns, refactoring, and agile development communities. Whether you're focused on legacy or “greenfield” development, this book will make you a better software designer by helping you learn how to make important design changes safely and effectively.}

However, such workloads are fundamental for understanding the way in which modern applications and data-processing frameworks use the JVM's concurrency features, and for validating new just-in-time (JIT) compiler optimizations that enable more efficient execution of such workloads. We present Renaissance, a new benchmark suite composed of modern, real-world, concurrent, and object-oriented workloads that exercise various concurrency primitives of the JVM. We show that the use of concurrency primitives in these workloads reveals optimization opportunities that were not visible with the existing workloads. We use Renaissance to compare performance of two state-of-the-art, production-quality JIT compilers (HotSpot C2 and Graal), and show that the performance differences are more significant than on existing suites such as DaCapo and SPECjvm2008. We also use Renaissance to expose four new compiler optimizations, and we analyze the behavior of several existing ones.

We present a new method for predicting software energy consumption to help debug software energy issues. Our approach enables developers to align traces of software behavior with traces of software energy consumption. This allows developers to match run-time energy hot spots to the corresponding execution. We accomplish this by applying recent neural network models to predict time series of energy consumption given a software's behavior. We compare our time series models to prior state-of-the-art models that only predict total software energy consumption.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

It is imperative that we realize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and improve the energy efficiency of data centers. With the advent of Intel Sandy Bridge processors, we have the ability to specify a limit on power consumption during runtime, which creates opportunities to design new power-management techniques for enterprise workloads and make the systems that they run on more energy proportional.},

Unfortunately, even a seemingly innocuous benchmarking mistake can compromise the guarantees provided by a given systems security defense and also put its reproducibility and comparability at risk. This threat is particularly insidious as it is generally not a result of malice and can easily go undetected by both authors and reviewers. Moreover, as modern defenses often trade off security for performance in an attempt to find an ideal design point in the performance-security space, the damage caused by benchmarking mistakes is increasingly worrisome. To analyze the magnitude of the phenomenon, we identify a set of 22 "benchmarking crimes" that threaten the validity of systems security evaluations and perform a survey of 50 defense papers published in top venues. To ensure the validity of our results, we perform the complete survey twice, with two independent readers. We find only a very small number of disagreements between readers, showing that our assessment of benchmarking crimes is highly reproducible. We show that benchmarking crimes are widespread even in papers published at tier-1 venues. We find that tier-1 papers commit an average of five benchmarking crimes and we find only a single paper in our sample that committed no benchmarking crimes. Moreover, we find that the scale of the problem is constant over time, suggesting that the community is not yet addressing it despite the problem being now more relevant than ever. This threatens the scientific process, which relies on reproducibility and comparability to ensure that published research advances the state of the art. We hope to raise awareness of these issues and provide recommendations to improve benchmarking quality and safeguard the scientific process in our community.},

However, physical experiments have shown that even under the same conditions, identical processors consume different amount of energy to complete the same task. While this manufacturing variability has been observed and studied before, there is lack of evidence supporting the hypotheses due to limited sampling data, especially from the thermal characteristics. In this article, we compare the power consumption among identical processors for two Intel processors series with the same TDP (Thermal Design Power) but from different generations. The observed power variation of the processors in newer generation is much greater than the older one. Then, we propose our hypotheses for the underlying causes and validate them under precisely controlled environmental conditions. The experimental results show that, with the increase of transistor densities, difference of thermal characteristics becomes larger among processors, which has non-negligible contribution to the variation of power consumption for modern processors. This observation reminds us of re-calibrating the precision of the current energy predictive models. The manufacturing variability has to be considered when building energy predictive models for homogeneous clusters.},

We currently work on a predictive model for energy consumption of a server, with inputs as service provided, hardware material equipped (type and quantity of processor, memory and hard drive) and technical environment (energy conversion and cooling). In this article, we characterize some potential factors on the power variation of the servers, such as: original fabrication, position in the rack, voltage variation and temperature of components on motherboard. The results show that certain factors, such as original fabrication, ambient temperature and CPU temperature, have noticeable effects on the power consumption of servers.

Witch performs no instrumentation. Hence, witchcraft---tools built atop Witch---can detect a variety of software inefficiencies while introducing negligible slowdown and insignificant memory consumption and yet maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive instrumentation tools. Witch allowed us to scale our analysis to a large number of code bases. Guided by witchcraft, we detected several performance problems in important code bases; eliminating these inefficiencies resulted in significant speedups.

	abstract     = {Dynamic scripting languages offer programmers increased flexibility by allowing properties of programs to be defined at run-time. Typically, program execution begins with an interpreter where type checks are implemented using conditional statements. Recent JIT compilers have begun removing run-time checks by specializing native code to program properties discovered at JIT time. This paper presents a novel intermediate representation for scripting languages that explicitly encodes types of variables. The dynamic representation is a flow graph, where each node is a specialized virtual instruction and each edge directs program flow based on control and type changes in the program. The interpreter thus performs specialized execution of whole programs. We present techniques for the efficient interpretation of our representation showing speed-ups of greater than 2x over static interpretation, with an average speed-up of approximately 1.3x.},

	abstract     = {Programs often follow implicit programming rules, such as, function call A must be followed by function call B. Rules of such kinds are rarely documented by developers. Nevertheless, programming rules play an important role in software testing and maintenance. For example, the rules can be used as test oracles to detect violations. If a programmer can be notified of these rules before updating the source code, the chances of generating defects due to rule violations might be minimized. Prior works have used static and dynamic analysis techniques to extract implicit programming rules, but none compares the effectiveness of the two techniques. In this paper, we have undertaken an empirical study to compare the two techniques when they are being used for extracting programming rules. Our results indicate that the performance of the dynamic analysis technique depends on the number and the diversity of the traces. Moreover, the dynamic analysis technique generates more precise rules than the static analysis technique if a diverse and sufficient number of test cases are provided.},

	abstract     = {As transistor scaling is reaching its limit, the viable supply voltage range where DVFS can operate is shrinking, which limits its effectiveness. To extend the performance-energy trade-off capabilities in modern processors, this paper proposes dynamic core scaling (DCS) that does not rely on voltage scaling. DCS dynamically adjusts the active superscalar datapath resources so that programs run at a given percentage of their maximum speed while minimizing energy consumption at the same time. Since DCS does not need voltage scaling, it can be combined with DVFS to achieve greater energy savings. To effectively manage performance-energy trade-offs using a combination of DCS and DVFS, this paper proposes an oracle controller that demonstrates the optimal control strategy, and two practical controllers that are applicable in real implementations. Evaluations using an 8-way superscalar processor implemented in 45nm circuit show that DCS is more effective in performance-energy trade-offs than DVFS at the high performance end for a number of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks. When used together with DVFS, DCS saves an additional 20\% of a full-size core's energy on average. At the minimum operating voltage, DVFS hits its limit, while DCS is still able to achieve an average of 46\% further energy reduction.},
